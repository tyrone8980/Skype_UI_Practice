# CodePath Week 1 Lab
Time: **45** minutes
# Objective: Create New Project
[X]Create a new android project (minSDK 16) and choose to create a "Empty Activity"
[X]Name the new empty activity as "LoginActivity"
[X]Clone Login Screen

Browse Login Screens on Android App Patterns. Review other app pattern resources for more variety.
Recreate one chosen login screen as closely as possible while using android views and layouts
Use actual views, text fields, layouts, buttons where possible. Don't just copy one big screenshot.
The goal is to clone the structure and layout of the screen but you can find other images or borrow from the reference implementation

I attempted to clone the Skype Log in user interface. An example can be found here:
